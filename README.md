## üß± Architecture ‚Äî MVVM

The project follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** design pattern:

- **Model** ‚Üí Defines the data structure for posts (`Post` model with `userId`, `id`, `title`, and `body`).  
- **ViewModel** ‚Üí Handles API fetching, search filtering, and favorite state management.  
- **View** ‚Üí Displays lists, details, and favorites using SwiftUI views.  

All networking logic is isolated from SwiftUI views to maintain a clean separation of concerns.

üí° Assumptions & Future Improvements

Currently, favorite status is stored in memory; it can be persisted using UserDefaults or CoreData in future versions.

UI can be enhanced with animations and a custom design system.

Pagination can be added for better performance with large datasets.

Unit tests can be implemented for ViewModel and APIService.
